* Fillet Minion

This is a spike app to help me understand the [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Minion][Minion]] job queue system.
To run this, just do the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

# install needed dependencies (Mojolicious and Minion dists)
cpanm --installdeps .

# in one terminal, run the webapp
morbo ./script/fillet_minion

# in another or more terminals, run the Minion workers
./script/fillet_minion minion worker

# to inspect worker/job status in another terminal
./script/fillet_minion minion job -s
./script/fillet_minion minion job -w

#+END_SRC
